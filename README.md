# fast-assembly-theory

This repo uses essentially C code with the C++ compiler incase I need some of those libraries.

## Todo

- [ ] Implement vanilla assembly theory algorithm for protein sequences (short ones since will be slow)
- [ ] Come up with plan to parallelize, put on faster hardware, or approximation algorithms that are faster
